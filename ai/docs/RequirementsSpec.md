# Continued Fraction Arithmetic Library Requirements Specification

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the requirements for a library that performs arithmetic on continued fractions using Gosper-style methods.

The library is intended to support mathematically correct, testable, demand-driven arithmetic on continued fractions, especially in the spirit of HAKMEM items 101A and 101B.

This specification is focused on requirements, not implementation details. It describes what the library must do, what guarantees it must provide, and what behaviors must be observable by callers and tests.

---

## 2. Background and Context

Continued fractions provide an alternative numeric representation with useful arithmetic properties, especially for exact and incremental computation.

The target library is intended to support:

- exact arithmetic on continued fractions
- demand-driven evaluation
- regular continued fractions (RCF) and generalized continued fractions (GCF)
- composable unary and binary arithmetic operators
- certified partial output when full evaluation is not yet available

The initial architecture should be aligned with Gosper-style homographic and bihomographic transformation machinery, while remaining testable and implementation-language-agnostic at the requirements level.

A major project milestone is the ability to compute the target formula:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{\frac{3}{\pi^2} + e}}{\tanh(\sqrt{5}) - \sin(69^\circ)}
\]

This milestone strongly influences the minimum required operator set and the shape of the first public API.

---

## 3. Scope

### 3.1 In Scope

The first versions of the library shall address:

- representation of regular continued fractions (RCF)
- representation of generalized continued fractions (GCF)
- exact `BigInt` and `Rational` support
- construction from integers and rationals
- construction from explicit finite RCF term lists
- construction from procedural infinite GCF sources
- exact comparison where possible
- unary and binary arithmetic over continued fractions
- demand-driven RCF term emission
- convergent and interval/range inspection
- diagnostics and observability for blocked or stalled operator states
- specialized named generators for important constants, including at least `pi` and `e`
- minimum unary operators needed for the target formula, including `sqrt`, `sin`, and `tanh`

### 3.2 Out of Scope for Initial Release

The first release is not required to include:

- graphical tools
- distributed computation
- hardened security features
- decimal or other radix digit emission as a completed feature
- unary operators beyond those required for the target formula and immediate architectural needs

Robustness is important, but security concerns are explicitly deferred in the early phases.

---

## 4. Goals

The library shall prioritize the following goals:

1. **Mathematical correctness first**
2. **Exactness over floating approximation**
3. **Demand-driven incremental evaluation**
4. **Strong testability and observability**
5. **Composable operator architecture**
6. **Support for infinite GCF-first development**
7. **A minimal public API sufficient to compute the target formula**
8. **Extensibility toward more advanced operators later**

Performance is not a primary goal.

---

## 5. Non-Goals

The library is not required to optimize primarily for:

- fixed-width machine arithmetic
- approximate floating-point throughput
- minimal abstraction count
- hiding internal state from tests when observability improves debugging or correctness validation
- finite-CF-first design assumptions in early development

---

## 6. Terminology and Definitions

This section defines the terms used throughout the specification.

### 6.1 BigInt
An arbitrarily large integer.

### 6.2 Rational
An exact rational value represented as `BigInt/BigInt`.

### 6.3 Regular Continued Fraction (RCF)
A continued fraction in regular form whose emitted terms are `BigInt` values.

### 6.4 Generalized Continued Fraction (GCF)
A continued fraction whose ingested source terms are `(p, q)` pairs, where both `p` and `q` are `BigInt` values.

### 6.5 Relationship Among Core Types
The following containment and conversion relationships apply:

- any integer can be represented as a `BigInt`
- any `BigInt` can be represented as a `Rational`
- any `Rational` can be represented as a finite `RCF`
- any `RCF` is a `GCF`

### 6.6 Infinite GCF Source
A source of `(p, q)` terms that is assumed infinite until exhausted.

### 6.7 Finite GCF
A GCF whose input source has been exhausted. A finite GCF is not a distinct external term format; it is a GCF whose source reached end-of-input.

### 6.8 Convergent
A finite rational approximation induced by a finite prefix of a continued fraction.

### 6.9 Certified Output
An emitted term, interval, comparison result, or other observable result that is mathematically justified by the information consumed so far.

### 6.10 Range
An interval-like object describing uncertainty about the final value of a GCF.

### 6.11 Inside Range
A range where `lo <= hi`, meaning the final value is inside the interval.

### 6.12 Outside Range
A range where `lo > hi`, meaning the final value is outside the interval.

### 6.13 Exact Point
A range where `lo == hi`, meaning the value is known exactly.

### 6.14 Homographic Transform / Unary LFT
A unary transform of the form:

\[
z(x)=\frac{ax+b}{cx+d}
\]

### 6.15 Bihomographic Transform / Binary LFT
A binary transform of the form:

\[
z(x,y)=\frac{axy+bx+cy+d}{exy+fx+gy+h}
\]

### 6.16 Diagonal LFT
A special case of a Binary LFT where the two operand variables are equal.

---

## 7. Supported Mathematical Objects

The library shall support the following categories of values.

### 7.1 Required
- `BigInt`
- `Rational`
- finite `RCF`
- infinite `RCF`
- infinite `GCF` sources
- in-memory `GCF` values with associated `Range`

### 7.2 External Representation Policy
External representation is either:

- `GCF` for ingestion
- `RCF` for emission

Only infinite GCF sources may be ingested as a series of `(p, q)` terms.

Only RCF terms, represented as `BigInt`, shall be emitted by the arithmetic core.

### 7.3 Input Assumption Policy
All continued-fraction inputs shall be treated as infinite until exhausted.

Early development shall assume infinite GCF input by default rather than designing first around finite continued fractions.

### 7.4 Optional / Deferred
- decimal digit emission
- arbitrary radix digit emission
- a unary operator that ingests a GCF and emits a `Rational` after consuming a specified number of input terms
- additional specialized named generators beyond the initial constant set

### 9.4 Exactness
If `lo == hi`, the final value is known exactly.

### 9.5 Comparison Ordering
`Range` shall define a comparison relation suitable for choosing among competing uncertainty descriptions.

The intended ordering is:

1. inside narrow
2. inside wide
3. outside wide
4. outside narrow

where earlier items are considered better / narrower / more informative than later items.

The exact formalization of “narrow” and “wide” shall be defined in the design and API documents, but the ordering semantics above are required.

### 18.2 Public API Style
The library shall expose a clean public API with clear separation between:

- user-facing value construction
- streaming evaluation
- diagnostics/testing hooks
- lower-level transform machinery

### 18.3 Streaming API
A caller shall be able to request the next emitted RCF term, next convergent, or next certified range without forcing complete materialization.

---

## 20. Testability Requirements

The design shall support iterative TDD and precise verification.

### 20.1 TDD Workflow
Development shall normally proceed in two phases:

1. create failing tests, allowing production stubs that return an incorrect value of the correct type
2. modify production code until those tests pass

The expected workflow is red, then green, then commit, then repeat.

### 20.2 Public vs Private Testing
The public interface shall be tested with black-box tests.

Private interfaces and internal machinery shall be tested with white-box tests.

However, implementations shall preserve the required mathematical behavior described here.

The initial implementation is expected to target Go.

---

## 23. Robustness and Security Considerations

Robustness is important and includes:

- bounded non-progress testing

Should `(p, q)` pairs be exposed directly in the public API or wrapped in higher-level abstractions?

### 25.3 Progress Strategy
What policy should govern source selection and output attempts in ambiguous operator states?

### 25.4 Range Ordering Formalization
How exactly should “inside narrow”, “inside wide”, “outside wide”, and “outside narrow” be measured and compared?

### 25.5 Stuck-State Semantics
How should the library report cases where evaluation appears to fail to make progress?

### 25.6 Debug Visibility
How much transform state should be exposed publicly versus only in test/debug paths?

### 25.7 Bounded Rational Collapse
What should be the exact semantics of the future unary operator that consumes a specified number of input terms and emits a `Rational`?

\[
\frac{\sqrt{\frac{3}{\pi^2} + e}}{\tanh(\sqrt{5}) - \sin(69^\circ)}
\]

with exact continued-fraction machinery, using named constant generators and the required unary and binary operators, without silently degrading to floating-point arithmetic.
